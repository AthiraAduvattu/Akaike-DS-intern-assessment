Structured Data Assignment and NLP Assignment
Problem Statement-Structured Data Assignment

Problem 1 - The development of drugs is critical in providing therapeutic options
for patients suffering from chronic and terminal illnesses. “Target Drug”, in particular,
is designed to enhance the patient's health and well-being without causing
dependence on other medications that could potentially lead to severe and
life-threatening side effects. These drugs are specifically tailored to treat a particular
disease or condition, offering a more focused and effective approach to treatment,
while minimising the risk of harmful reactions.
The objective in this assignment is to develop a predictive model which will predict
whether a patient will be eligible*** for “Target Drug” or not in next 30 days. Knowing
if the patient is eligible or not will help physician treating the patient make informed
decision on the which treatments to give.
*** - A patient is considered eligible for a particular drug when they have taken their
first prescription for that drug. 

NLP Assignment
Creation of Objective Questions with Multiple Correct Answersusing generative text models
Objective
The goal of this internship assignment is to test your proficiency in natural language
processing. You will be tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate
objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject.
The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have
more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the
questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the
chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different
perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust
and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging
assessments for their students.
